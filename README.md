# Order and Chaos

by Elbergg

## Game rules

Order and Chaos is a tic-tac-toe variant in which one side plays as Order and the other (as you can guess) as Chaos.

Order's task is to get 5 X's or O's in a row, Chaos needs to stop him. Order always starts.

Both sides can place either an `X` or an `O`

## Overview

The player can choose between two different game modes:

- PVP: Challenge your friend into a gruesome fight! (Elbergg and co. isn't responsible for any damage caused by brawls between the raging participants)

- PVE: Try your luck against:
  
  - A random bot: as the name implies, he will choose his moves on random
  
  - An expert bot: an EVIL machine made with only one thing in mind - DEFEATING YOU! (It uses the Minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning with the depth of 3,  so you will need to think 4 steps ahead to win, good luck!)

## Controls

They are preety simple:

-  left mouse button to place an `X` 

- right mouse button to place an `O`
